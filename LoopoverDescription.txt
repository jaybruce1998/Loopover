Everybody likes sliding puzzles! For this kata, we're going to be looking at a special type of sliding puzzle called Loopover. With Loopover, it is more like a flat rubik's cube than a sliding puzzle. Instead of having one open spot for pieces to slide into, the entire grid is filled with pieces that wrap back around when a row or column is slid. For example, if we have the grid:

ABCDE<br/>
FGHIJ<br/>
KLMNO<br/>
PQRST<br/>
UVWXY<br/>

and we do R0 (move the 0th row right) then we get:

EABCD<br/>
FGHIJ<br/>
KLMNO<br/>
PQRST<br/>
UVWXY<br/>

Likewise, if we do L0, we get:

ABCDE<br/>
FGHIJ<br/>
KLMNO<br/>
PQRST<br/>
UVWXY<br/>

if we do U2:

ABHDE<br/>
FGMIJ<br/>
KLRNO<br/>
PQWST<br/>
UVCXY<br/>

and if we do D2 we will once again return to the original grid. With all of this in mind, I'm going to make a Loopover with a scrambled grid, and your solve method will give me an ArrayList of moves I can do to get back to the solved grid I give you.

For example:

SCRAMBLED GRID:

DEABC<br/>
FGHIJ<br/>
KLMNO<br/>
PQRST<br/>
UVWXY<br/>

SOLVED GRID:

ABCDE<br/>
FGHIJ<br/>
KLMNO<br/>
PQRST<br/>
UVWXY<br/>

One possible solution would be ["L0", "L0"]
Another would be ["R0", "R0", "R0"]
etc. etc.

Good luck! Let me know if there are any issues with the kata! :)
